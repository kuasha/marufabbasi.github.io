I have completed my bachelor degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Computer Science and Engineering department of Shah Jalal University of Science and Technology, Bangladesh which has a acceptance rate of less than 1% of applicants. During my study period there I represented the University in collegiate programming contests and placed 10th in ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, Dhaka Region in 2002.

I worked on a thesis on migrating running processes from one system to another and for that developed a Java Virtual Machine from scratch using C++. I have also developed a JIT compiler for the JVM to improve its performance.

After graduating, I started my career as a Software Engineer and worked in various technologies including DICOM, HL7, Windows device driver, authorization and control system of Microsoft Exchange, Microsoft Exchange Data Center deployment technologies, Microsoft MapReduce engine COSMOS, Monitoring, developed large scale data processing service (patent pending), web front end using Knockout and JQuery etc.

As a open source project I have developed an application framework that exposes RESTful services to store retrieve structured (JSON) data and files and configure authorization without writing code. Business logic can be written as event based hooks or plain python/tornado services. It has a built-in application builder with drag-drop form and page builder.

Specialties: Large scale data collections and Analytics, DICOM, Secutity, Role Based Access Control

Awards:
Caradigm Applications award (1st place) (10/2013).
Caradigm Team Player award for Speed Table from CEO (2014).
Microsoft Ideas of Innovation (2009).
ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest Dhaka Region - 10th Place (2002).
Patent: Speed Table for large scale data processing.

I have been mentioned in the past for being able to complete tasks in tight deadline with limited resources.
