Building ventilators are not as easy as building masks. But a ventilator is basically an air pump that 
can control air flow volume, pressure, rate and way to detect patients own respiration status. 

We will need pressure sensors, air compressor, air tank, valves, air pressure regulator etc. as well as 
a way to control all the parameterws for different mode of operaqtions. A small microcontroller and a 
LCD display can take responsibility of controllong the device and showing status.
