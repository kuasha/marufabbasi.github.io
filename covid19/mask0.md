## Creating a simple mask

We have a massive shortage of masks as of today because of COVID-19 pandemic. 
While in normal times it may not be safe to tell people to build their own masks, it may reduce some risk if sick people 
uses something to cover their mouth and nose.

## The v0 design 
*** the design is not ready yet ***

We do not want anything complicated but just follow a standard mask design and create a resusable mask for few cents each.

### Materials

We need fabric, elastic ribbon, cutting tool and swing equipment. Hand swing or machine swing both should work. First version does not use a metal wire to shape it to nose. I am looking for a suitable metal wire to put on one side so we can bend it to shape around the nose. Not doing that causes one problem- it'll send the exhaled breath upward and make it really uncomfortable to wear. But this is a good start. Now need to work on making it such that air flows through fabric only.

The fabric is most important matrerial. If we can choose right material and make a good seal the mask should be effective.

## Testing

Ideally we want to use an automated test system where we use several mask and flow air with tiny nano particles on one side and measure how many of the particles are passing. An effective system will be expensive but I am looking for cheap components to get close to ideal situation.
