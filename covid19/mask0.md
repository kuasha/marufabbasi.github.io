## Creating a simple mask

We have a massive shortage of masks as of today because of COVID-19 pandemic. 
While in normal times it may not be safe to tell people to build their own masks, it may reduce some risk if sick people 
uses something to cover their mouth and nose.

## The v0 design 

We do not want anything complicated but just follow a standard mask design and create a resusable mask for few cents each.

## Materials

We need fabric, elastic ribbon, cutting tool and swing equipment. Hand swing or machine swing both should work.
