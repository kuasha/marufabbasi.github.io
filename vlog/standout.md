# How to stand out in a crowd

In a time when everyone is trying to stand out I look for work done with love. 
Not becuase the artist tries to do something that makes him famous but because he or she loves what he does. 

Make something that is makes other peoples live better. It can be an object or a paintingware or a movie. 
Do not seek attention.
