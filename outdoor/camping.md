## Camping

By Helali Bhuiyan

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
People have asked what to get for camping, especially who are new/first timer. Here is a list of items I would suggest. Suggestions welcome from other people.

IaaS

1. Tent
a. You need to multiply by 2 of your headcount.
b. If there are three people, buy a tent of at least 6/5 people. People with two kids, bigger the better. We have a ten person tent. You will need some extra space inside to store your suitcase/luggage 
c. Tents should come with stakes, buying a few extra does not hurt. Cheap at Fredmeyer
d. Get a mallet or plastic hammer for easy stake installation. Also helps when removing tent
e. Tents are usually by default rain proof. Check the description. I never used extra rain fly.
2. Tarp
a. To put under the tent, prevents water seething, heat/cold.
b. Also helps as a door mat for the tent entry.
c. A door mat is also a good option. Inside tent will get dusty pretty quick as kids come and go
3. Bed
a. Multiple options. Air mattress is the worst. Don’t do it
b. Self inflatable pad in my experience is the best. This is what I have. It’s a good investment. Buy once, sleep well for years to come. The most important equipment for camping is a comfy bed.

4. Pillows
5. Bed sheet
6. Comforter/sleeping bag/blanket. It will be cold at night, like 50F

PaaS

1. Folding chairs. Fredmeyer is a good source. Cheap ones work just fine. One per person.
2. Big lamp, at least one. Costco has a good one with D batteries.
3. Small hand held lamps. You will need them to move around at night, especially when going to the restroom
4. Extra batteries for lamps
5. Clothes as appropriate. Days will be mildly hot, even at 70. When sun hits you, its gonna be hot. Inside tent will be the worst.
6. Hats
7. Easy/comfy shoes, flip flops
8. Jackets for night, light clothes for day
9. Luggage/suitcase to hold your clothes/items
10. Umbrella in case of rain
11. Pocket knife
12. Binoculars if you are into it
13. Walkie talkie. Some of us have one. Phones don't always work. These are really handy but not necessary. We have this one

14. Sports equipment 
a. Bahlul is getting volleyball net and the whole setup
b. We also need cricket/badminton/football
c. Anything else you want to bring to have fun
d. Anything to keep your kids busy


Food/Cooking
1. Girls should be planning what to eat. There should be a separate thread on this
2. Cooler storage. Get a mid to big one. Good investment
3. Grill machine
a. Not absolutely required. Depends on other people. We have several people who have big ones already. We can share them
b. In case you want to buy one, this one is really good.
c. https://www.amazon.com/Coleman-9949-750-Road-Trip-Grill/dp/B0009V1BDA/
4. Gas for grill
5. Cup/plate/spoon/tong
6. Big bowl to serve food
7. Water
8. Ice for cooler storage
9. Lighter/match/lighter fluid to start fire
10. Firewood. Each family bring three. VERY important
11. Paper towel
12. Trash bag
13. Dish soap
14. Cooking oil/spray
15. Pots/pans if you want to cook something small. Depends on our food plan though. Some of our grill machines already come with frying pans
16. Tea tower, at least one for all of us
a. Need an owner for this one
17. Tea, sugar, cups
18. Can opener
19. Coke/drinks can
20. Knife/spatula
21. Sponge to wash dishes


Personal
1. Toile paper. The restroom there is like any public restroom. Has flush toilets with toilet paper, basin, soap. But bring some for backup.
2. Towel/soap/shampoo for shower. The restroom has coin operated hot shower, if you want one
3. Hand soap/sanitizer
4. Toothpaste/brush
